Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio! 
I'm Gene Reneil L. Campillos, a fresh graduate from the University of the East Manila.

I'm still working on my portfolio and I aspire to specialize in the field of Data: Analytics, Science, & Engineering
as learning the ways in the world of data gives us the opportunity to innovate better endeavors we set our minds to. 
Data is the new oil of the digital world and it is arguably the most essential 
driving force of any project in any given field. 

For a starter you may refer to our capstone project: 
Acne and Eczema Skin Disease Detection System w/ Suggestive Medication Treatment using CNN
(The CNN models will be available in a google drive folder as the repository only limits for up to 25mb)
